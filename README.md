# HtmlCssExcercises
This README will serve as a guide for the reader, in an effort to describe what I learned or was practicing in each excercise. This is not everything I have worked on, as I've been on various code-learning sites and using their text editors or input boxes to practice code. This is however, code that I used to practice concepts as I learned them. Enjoy!

firstPage.html:

This was literally my first html document ever. I used it to practice very basic markup so that I could structure a web page. Behind the scenes, I picked out a text editor (Atom) and and installed various packages that seemed useful.

Blog.html/css:

This was something I used to play around with how I would want a blog to look like using html and css. It was pretty cool making this because it was the first time I created something remotely interesting, on my own. I even detailed it a little bit.

photoGrid.html/css:

This was kinda cool too, the most interesting part about this excercise was figuring out how to space the pictures 3 to a row, and to do so with perfect spacing. 

pokemonChart.html: 

This excercise was used to practice using tables and organizing the data, as well as linking it to another website for more information

selectors.html/css: 

This was purely a css selector excercise, where I simply practiced targeting elements, this allowed me to become more familiar with carious css properties and targeting elements with css. The html markup was downloaded from one of the paid resources I use to learn.

submitionForms.html: 

This excersie was very exciting for me. It was the first time I learned something I felt was actually practical. For some reason, it gave me a hard time initially, but I was able to grasp it after a short break.

booStrap.html/css:

This is where I was introduced to a library. It was really cool and useful and I'm sure I'll use it much more in the future, but I wanted to stay away from it initially because I felt that I needed to practice building things like nav bars on my own.
